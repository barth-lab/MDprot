function [A, D, I] = calcAffinityMat(X, options)
    % Calculate affinity matrix A from an input dataset X using k nearest
    % neighbors.
    % 
    %% Usage:
    % [A] = calcAffinityMat(X, options)
    %
    %% Description:
    % * X input dataset with size N x M, where N is the number of
    % observations and M is the number of dimensions
    % * A affinity matrix 
    % * D distances between observation i and its k nearest neighbors (k x
    % N)
    % * I indices of observation i and its k nearest neighbors (k x N)
    %
    % * options:
    %       kNN: number of nearest neighbors, play with this number to
    %       capture the relationship between datapoints, defaults to 5
    %       distanceMetric: distance metric used to check for nearest
    %       neoghbors, defaults to 'euclidean'. Any options available for
    %       pdist2 can be used
    %       selfTuning: Apply local scaling as in: Zelink-Manor and Perona, 
    %       Self-Tuning Spectral Clustering, 2004. Defaults to 0. The input
    %       number is the nearest neighbor for which the local scaling will
    %       be computed, a recommended value is 7
