In this folder we find functions to calculate correlations from MD trajectories using pearson coefficients ('corrMap') or mutual information, along with entropies. 
The  same analysis can be done with dihedrals, where the function 'calcalldihedralsfromtrajs' extractts backbone (phi and psi) and side  chain (chi1 ... chiN) dihedrals.
